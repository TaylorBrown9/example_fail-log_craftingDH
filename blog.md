Week one - 
using the command line in DH Box went over well. I had success using all commands up until xercise 4.7. I was able to fork another persons repository and make a pull request in GitHub but when I needed to enter commands in DH Box for this I continued to get a message saying fatal:not a git repository. I am still unable to figure this one out. 
Using Dillinger - I could not open it on the first day that I tried but it is now working. I wrote about an annotation and entered the html for a picture but the picture did not show. After watching the video for this in the workbook it seems that the website has been updated so I could not follow the steps as it is looking completely different now. 


Week two-
I am finding the exercises are becoming tougher. The videos are helpful and I can (usually) resolve the problem I face after watching. I ran into some trouble converting images with both the command line and R studio. After posting in Slack I was given advice and was able to get the command line working. I annotated where I ran into trouble. I am still unsure if I am doing my fail log correctly, but I changed the format in which I am using it in hopes that I can reference back to it, but I am finding it much easier to reference back to the previous weeks' module when stuck. 
This week I read the article about Bentham. I found many aspects of this article similiar to this current course. The article mentioned training videos and a social space for individuals to post questions/feedback. I find that these videos and the Slack conversations to be the main reason that I am able to get through most exercises. Without these I would be very lost. I am glad that our course does not use a 'Benthamometer' as I would find that seeing a leaderboard would cause stress onto an already somewhat stressful course. I feel as though this course causes the most stress because I am doing many things with a computer that I have never done before so everything is a new experience leaving any errors I encounter to be unsolvable on my own.
