I found this week's requirements to go over quite well. 
I was able to create all accounts needed without any difficulty and 
was able to navigate the websites okay considering I have never worked with 
any programs like these before. I found the most difficult part was trying to 
figure out how to paste an annotation here without having the entire URL. 
I am still unable to figure out how to do this.
