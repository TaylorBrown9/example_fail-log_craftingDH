So far I am finding this course very interesting as I have never used 
programs like these before. I found it very easy to create the various accounts 
needed. I was able to navigate the websites quite well. I found great difficulty
in trying to figure out how to place my annotations on this page without pasting the entire
URL link. I am still unable to figure out how to make a word clickable to take me directly
to my annotation.
